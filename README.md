# SpotlightProject

A questionnaire application (Cardiovascular risk evaluator) was built using Pure Python. 

The app was created in a week, since this was one of our proposed solutions for our problem pitch for the Spotlight Mentorship Program.
To run the quiz, go to "dist" folder and run "quiz_skeleton.exe".

The Blindspot we were trying to address was:
Lack of technological innovation in healthcare such as AI assisted analysis and diagnosis
